## Overview for Assignment 0

> "Before software should be reusable, it shound be usable." 
    - Ralph Johnson

**I'm very excited for this class and I can't wait to learn and am particularly interested in**
1. IoT drivers and how interoperabiality makes systems applicable and easier to use
2. Looking into different connection protocols (I2C, SPI, UDP/TCP)
3. Using different platforms and expanding the coding knowledge I already have into more CPE applicable tasks

### With this class: 
![raspberrypi](raspberryPi4.jpg)

- My first experience with a raspberry pi was my sophmore year in HS where I did a hack a thon and won one
- This summer I worked with a STM chip to get USBPD working for a display port => hdmi 
- I learned a lot about USB-C and the different CC lines
- I am just very interested in learning, so this class is gonna be right up my alley

### If I wanted to use python with a raspberrypi to light an LED 

```
 In [1]: from gpiozero import LED
 In [2]: led = LED(17)
```

~~I have to remember how to do all of this~~

`Making sure that this is set with code`
