### I'm very excited for this class and I can't wait to learn and am particularly interested in
1. IoT drivers and how interoperabiality makes systems applicable and easier to use
2. Looking into different connection protocols (I2C, SPI, UDP/TCP)
3. Using different platforms and expanding the coding knowledge I already have into more CPE applicable tasks



~~I have to remember how to do all of this~~

`Making sure that this is set with code`
