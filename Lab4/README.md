# Lab 4


### Django Structure and FLASK 
- Install Django + REST and use a database structure 
- the plan is to do this via virtual machine
    * if I have time I want to try to do it with my personal computer as well

1. Set up Django + Rest
    2. set up mariadb server + client
    3. Setting up stevens
    *   doing this by following the steps,
    * I've never set up my own django app (or used django before)
    4. setting up api key => getting annoyed since i didnt share a clipboard with my vm 
    * I was able to get the weather app working
    * ![weather](weather.png)

    ### Setting up mycpu
    1. Setting up the myCPU was a lot easier (on the code side) after the weather station
    * I was even able to utilize the copying skills so that I wouldn't have to recopy over the API key since I had to manually type it
    * ![used](cpUSEDfile.png)
    2. The rest of the steps I documented with pictures
    * ![cpu](mycpu.png)
    * ![super](super user.png)
    * ![term](terminal.png)
    3. **I have everything documented for this lab except for the cpu web page actually working, so if you have any insight (as I followed the directions and double checked several times and still had no success**
