**Command Line Lab** 
### I'm still deciding if I will be using a VM or going through Powershell/Windows terminal (but it's annoying)

---
This lab was running different linux commands
- I have used many of these commands when I was working over the summer
- env, cd, ls, hostname, cat, ifconfig, ping, and netstat I used all of the time.

1. **Hostname**
    * used when grabbing the hostname of the device, in this case it was "raspberry"

I'm running using raspberry pi OS on VM since I wanted to emulate on my machine
